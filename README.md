# MovieLeague

The Movie League app is intended to be a solo project based on the idea of Music League but with a twist. The initial format is to create a League (or group), submit movies based on the category criteria, and vote on your favorites suggested by others in the league. Points will be dolled out by you and your competitors and tallied throughout the rounds. There will be limited amounts of time to watch the films, as well as vote. May the best cinefile win!
